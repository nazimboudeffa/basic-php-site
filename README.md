# Basic PHP Site

This is a template to manage PHP/MySQL basic code like creating an account

## How to install

Clone the repo and install XAMPP [HowTo](https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/nazimboudeffa.github.io/wiki/XAMPP)

Open your phpmyadmin and create a new database and call it **basic-php-site** then import basic-php-site.sql from install folder (will make it automatic later)

Edit connect.php file in config folder and set the username and password of the database you've created
